Speech is one of the most common ways of communication and the most of the population in our world relies on speech to communicate with each other.
In this project, the application will be based on machine learning algorithms that useIVR- Interactive voice response. 
Using this,people can control their mail accounts using only their voice and they can also perform send, receive, read and any other useful tasks. 
In this project, It directly convert the conversation (i.e., press meet or formal meetings) text format and mail it directly to the head office. 
This is really a useful process where it makes the process easy and the data can be transferred in efficient way. 
This project converts the voice (meeting conversation) into speech using machine learning and then we would store this text and send it as a mail to the sender mentioned using python libraries. 
This would eliminate the manual work which is time taking and also would produce efficient output. 
This project also includes text summarization and speech recognition in other languages. 
Text summarization is a technique that is used to shorten large data.
The aim is to create a consistent and fluid summary that includes only the main points described in the document.
Machine learning models are generally trained to understand documents and extract useful information before creating the required summary texts.
